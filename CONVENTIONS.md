# Code Conventions

When writing code, it's important to follow certain conventions to ensure consistency and readability. Here are some code conventions based on how I write code:

1. **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. Avoid using abbreviations or single-letter names unless they are widely accepted conventions.

2. **Indentation**: Use consistent indentation to improve code readability. Typically, a tab or four spaces are used for indentation.

3. **Spacing**: Use spaces around operators and after commas to improve code readability. For example, `x = 5 + 3` instead of `x=5+3`.

4. **Comments**: Use comments to explain complex logic, provide context, or document important information. Use clear and concise comments that add value to the code.

5. **Function Length**: Keep functions short and focused. Aim for functions that do one thing and do it well. If a function becomes too long, consider refactoring it into smaller, more manageable functions.

6. **Error Handling**: Properly handle errors and exceptions in your code. Use try-catch blocks or appropriate error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and prevent crashes.

7. **Code Formatting**: Use consistent code formatting throughout your codebase. This includes consistent line breaks, spacing, and alignment. Consider using a code formatter or linter to enforce consistent formatting.

8. **When working with Laravel**: it's recommended to follow the naming conventions for files to maintain consistency and improve code organization. Here are some common naming conventions used in Laravel:

    8.1. **Class Names**: Class names should be in PascalCase, starting with an uppercase letter. For example, `UserController` or `ProductModel`.

    8.2. **File Names**: File names should match the class name they contain. For example, the `UserController` class should be defined in a file named `UserController.php`.

    8.3. **Controller Names**: Controllers should be suffixed with the word "Controller". For example, `UserController` is a controller that handles user-related actions.

    8.4. **Model Names**: Models should be singular and use PascalCase. For example, `User` or `Product`.

    8.5. **Migration Names**: Migrations should be descriptive and use snake_case. For example, `create_users_table` or `add_email_to_users_table`.

    8.6. **View Names**: Views should be named using snake_case and can be suffixed with the file extension. For example, `welcome.blade.php` or `users/index.blade.php`.

    8.7. **Route Names**: Routes should be named using snake_case and can be prefixed with a module or resource name. For example, `users.index` or `admin.products.show`.

Following these naming conventions not only helps in organizing your codebase but also makes it easier for other developers to understand and navigate your Laravel project.

Remember, these code conventions are based on my personal preferences. Feel free to adapt them to suit your own coding style and the conventions followed by your team or organization.
